# 3-Axis Motion System

I originally built this for a school project for a short 7-week Arduino class
I took a few years back. The first version of this was my final project for 
said class. 

Now, I have rebuilt this project from the ground up, using completely different
hardware and designs. The full assembly can be found in the `SolidWorks_Parts`
directory, along with the parts used in that assembly.

All the parts in the `Not_my_parts` directory are taken from McMaster-Carr
to use as reference parts. 

The code contains all the code needed to run the project. The project consists
of 3 NEMA-17 stepper motors and drivers, 3 reed switches, a simple 5-pin joystick,
and a Teensy microcontroller. 

Upload the code found in `Code/main` and wire up the parts accordingly, and move
the system around with the joystick.
